This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

This week assignment is to illustrate data manipulation.

1. retrieve a data set from UCI Machine Learning repository, Data Set = Flags


```{r}
flags <- read.csv("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/flags/flag.data", header = FALSE)
```

2. Add Column Names
The data set has no header, hence we will append column headers, column headers will be assigned based on the metadata information in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/flags/flag.names.txt


```{r}
names(flags) <- c("name", "landmass", "zone", "area", "population", "language", "religion", "bars", "stripes", "colours",
                   "red", "green", "blue", "gold", "black", "white", "orange", "mainhue", "circles", "crosses", "saltires", 
                  "quarter", "sunstars", "crescent", "triangle", "icon", "animate", "text", "topleft", "botright")

```

3. Subset Rows and Columns

we will now show the first few rows of the data set
```{r}
head(flags) 
```

we will only consider rows where landmass = N. America (1) or Europe (3)

```{r}
myflags <- subset(flags, landmass == "1" | landmass == "3")

```

We will only consider the columns name, landmass, and bars through text.  

```{r}
myflags_1 <- subset(myflags, select = name:landmass)
myflags_2 <- subset(myflags, select = bars:text)
myflags_new <- cbind(myflags_1, myflags_2)
```


4. Map value of landmass as follows 1 : N_America and 3 : Europe

```{r}
require(plyr)

myflags_new$landmass <- mapvalues(myflags_new$landmass, 
                               from=c("1","3"), 
                               to=c("N_America","Europe"))
```

5. Display transformed data set

```{r}
myflags_new
```
